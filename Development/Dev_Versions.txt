4.0.7.6 (13 Sept 2020)

1. Fixed   - possible crash with long symbol names.
2. Fixed   - "}" Brackets in wrong place with bit names
3. Fixed   - Split comments not handled correctly with an3b, an3w
4. Fixed   - Split comments wrongly adds extra spaces if "\|" sequence is at end of comment
5. Changed - Symbol Names can now be up to 96 characters.

4.0.7.7 (11 Oct 2020)

Fixed    - Extra spaces printed in some comment lines.
Fixed    - Extra quotes in name and leading spaces after a quote confuses command processing
Fixed    - Faulty printout of bitwise code for some AD3W opcodes (when they should be ADD) 
Fixed    - Overlap of some functions and tables not detected, leading to faulty printout
Fixed    - Incorrect bank calculated for some opcodes, leading to wrong or missing symbols (Multibanks)
Improved - Sizes of subroutine arguments better (i.e. word or byte) after bugs found. Still not perfect.
Added    - better detection of single 'fill' bytes, now printed as 'fill' instead of '???'


4.0.7.8 (28 Oct 2020)

Fixed -  Missing symbols when processed in 'not SYM' commands (i.e. WORD 3234 3235 "MyName" not handled correctly, but SYM 3234 "MyName" was).
         May still be incorrect for multibank argument symbols.

NB. This is an interim release - made some big internal changes to code, which should not be visible to users (I hope !). 
Trying to improve subroutine arguments, for recognition of size, symbols and other features (encoded works, but not always, offsets do not).

4.0.7.9 (4 Dec 2020)

Fixed - Bank detect not picking up banks correctly in some binaries - changed detect algorithm
Changed internal bank handling so that addresses without bank can be recognised, so symbol names are better resolved for subroutine arguments. 

4.0.7.10 (12 Dec 2020)

Fixed - Possible crash with corrupt or non-806x binaries.
Fixed - 'catch22' where non-detect of banks could not be overriden with user commands.  More error checks added here too.
Fixed - Incorrect bank processing for sym names in multibanks.

Changed - default to adding bank 1 in multibanks for addresses with no bank.  (NB. This cannot work in all cases, only where use is obviously an address)

4.0.7.11 (21 Dec 2020)

Fixed - Comments get pushed up to start of bank (multibanks only).
Fixed - Bit-wise opcodes not displaying symbols above bit 7 for CLRW (incorrectly set as byte)
Fixed - 'W' flag with symbols not working if set in upper byte.
Fixed - According to Ford manuals, the 'odd address' word mode for 8065 CPU does not apply for registers below R20.
Fixed - internal change to ranges indexing for symbols and rbases, it was possible to 'lose' a symbol entirely.
