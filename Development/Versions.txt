4.15.1

This version does not fix specific bugs, but has major internal changes in the way it processes opcodes.
Previous to this opcodes were reprocessed at each stage from the binary image (scan,print etc.) so there was no continuity
of opcodes+operands in each stage. This didn't support some of the improvments planned.
This version has master list of all processed opcodes+operands, allowing better 'forwards/backwards' operations, used
for several things in the code (conditonal jumps, argument sizing etc), and future.

Some bugs ARE likely fixed, but frankly I have not kept detailed track of them.  I have checked that prinouts match.
released for comments.









4.14.3

1. Fixed  - columns not lining up in 'struct' printouts when used in 'compact' mode 
2. Fixed  - Rbase registers in the 'lookup list' (0x2020 or 2060 in most bins) get incorrectly marked as invalid. 
3. Fixed  - Autoincrement should invalidate a possible rbase register (not 2020/2060 list ones).   
4. Fixed  - Push of immediate value (i.e. as address) may have wrong bank (symbols will not match, subroutine not always scanned) 
4. Fixed  - an3b,w and ad3b,w opcodes not showing correct number of operands.
5. Fixed  - data commands with extra options (mainly user) may get merged incorrectly.
6. Change - use slightly more relaxed rule to scan for code gaps. (was too lax, made stricter, now in between) 
7. Change - install newer version of 'signature/fingerprint' locator for special subroutines etc.
 


4.14.2

 Many regression errors from merge of version 5 code, to move forwards with functionality.
 Changes are true multibit fields, 'cleaner' operand handling,
 including 'per operand' status flags (read,write,sign,indexed, indirect etc).

 1. Fixed  - Symbols can get confused between read and write 
 2. Fixed  - Incorrect register shown on special func subroutines (FUNCLU, TableLU)
 3. Fixed  - Indirect references to registers drops 'R' format (shows '[]' format)
 4. Fixed  - Operand sizes incorrect for some opcodes.
 5. Fixed  - DJNZ shows a zero register
 6. Fixed  - Bit numbers show +64 or +96 (status flags not masked out)

Other.

7. Fixed  - 'Odd word address' shortcut not working correctly for some operands
8. Fixed.  After a CMP (compare) sometimes the wrong operands are picked up.





4.14.1

1. Change printout to show two lines for divide, normalize, to show extra registers affected.
2. Install multibit field handling, copied from version 5.
3. (Internal) tidy handling of read vs. write operands for symbol names
