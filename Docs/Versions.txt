** Version 3.06 *****************

Fixed the ADDC for folowing JC/JNC not including carry flag in comment
Added check for JC/JNC after INC or DEC opcodes.
Changed shifts to put a comment for equivalent multiply and divide instead of substituting it.
Removed incorrect debug info in subroutine listings.
Fixed - JNVT sometimes prints as "if (CY)" should be "if (OVT)"
Fixed - NRML opcode prints as "Rxx = NRML(0);"  instead of "NRML(Ryy);"
Reorder internal index tables for opcodes (declared this in case new bug pops up) 
Change (long) and (int)  to LR and WR format, add S (signed) and Y (byte) where relevant for extra clarity.
Add glossary at top of listing.
Remove 'V' option (divisor) for words and bytes - it doesn't work anyway.
Fixed - bug which can 'lose' commands - error in address overlap checking.
