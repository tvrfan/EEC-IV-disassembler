 Fixed error in argument size for subroutines defined by command (in dir file)
 Fixed further error in JC/JNC and some conditional jumps pseudo code not showing correct

Another Carry fix.  Some cases now shown as a COMMENT instead.
Fix error with % in symbol names

Improve autodetection of signed/unsigned with auto subroutine name option for 2D (tables)
Autodetect not perfect yet....

** Version 3.06 *****************

Fixed the ADDC for folowing JC/JNC not including carry flag in comment
Added check for JC/JNC after INC or DEC opcodes.
Changed shifts to put a comment for equivalent multiply and divide instead of substituting it.

Removed incorrect debug info in subroutine listings.

Fixed - JNVT sometimes prints as "if (CY)" should be "if (OVT)"
Fixed - NRML opcode prints as "Rxx = NRML(0);"  instead of "NRML(Ryy);"

Reorder internal index tables for opcodes (declared this in case new bug pops up) 

change (long) and (int)  to LR and WR format, add S (signed) and Y (byte) where relevant for extra clarity.

Add glossary at top of listing.

Remove 'V' option (divisor) for words and bytes - it doesn't work anyway.

Fixed - bug which can 'lose' commands - error in address overlap checking.
